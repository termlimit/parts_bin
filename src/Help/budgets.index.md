On this page, you can set budgets for every category. Each budget is valid for the current time period.  Budgets can only be set for categories that have no child categories.  The system will automatically sum the budgets.

To set a buget simply type a number into the input box and hit enter!  It is that easy.  You can see how you are doing at the top of the screen.  You can also see the top categories you are overspending on.

You do not have to make a new budget every month.  Select "Copy budgets to..." to automatically copy the budget to the next month.  In addition to this, you can copy the budget for the rest of the year!

Happy budgeting!!
