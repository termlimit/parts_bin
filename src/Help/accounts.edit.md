The steps required to add an account change depending on the type of account you want to enter.

#### Asset accounts ####

If you're creating an asset account, you should fill in the "opening balance" and the date you want to the system to recognize as the entered date. Very few people start using LoadedFinance and have a 0.00 balance.  You can also enter an expiration date that the account will expire. When you close a credit card for example, you can set the account to expire, this preserves the data associated with the account and allows you to still view it when looking at historical data.

#### Expense accounts ####

Expense account balances can start at $0.00 or you can enter a balance if you know how much you spent at that local coffee shop!

#### Liability accounts ####

Liability accounts should have an opening balance, usually the current balance

#### Revenue accounts ####

Revenue account balances can start at $0.00

#### Service accounts ####

Can be entered with a $0.00 balance
